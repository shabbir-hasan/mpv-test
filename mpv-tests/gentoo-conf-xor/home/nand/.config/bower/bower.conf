# How to run notmuch and notmuch-deliver.
# Set these if notmuch or notmuch-deliver are not already on your PATH.
# I run bower locally but keep my mail and notmuch on a remote machine,
# accessed via ssh.  That requires an extra level of shell quoting, which
# is achieved with a small zsh helper script.
#
# You may like to enable the OpenSSH ControlMaster option, and also set
# ControlPersist to greater than 60 seconds (the polling period in the
# index view).

# How to edit a message.
# The default is to use $EDITOR, or else "vi".

# How to send a message.
# The default is to use sendmail (untested) but I use msmtp.
# The command should understand the "-t" option, to read recipients
# from the message headers itself.

# Command to execute after the sendmail command is successful.
# The default is to use notmuch-deliver to add the sent message to the
# maildir.  You can disable it by setting an empty command.
