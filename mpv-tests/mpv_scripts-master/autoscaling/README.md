# autoscaling

[mpv](https://mpv.io/) script to disable video scaling if video is slightly smaller than window size.

For example, your monitor is 1920x1080, the video is 1920x816 (2.35:1 aspect ratio), scaling is disabled.

The "window-scale" will be set to 1 and "border" set to "no" if the video is within range, this is to simplify how the script functions.

Edit the script settings at line ~35.
